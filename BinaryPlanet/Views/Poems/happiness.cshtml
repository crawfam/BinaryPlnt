                        happiness must be possible [else why would we pursue it]<br />
                        but wait a minute [it might be something like] “world peace”<br />
                        which we think will happen someday [but it’s hard to imagine]<br />
                        so what would happiness look like [does it come in colors]<br />
                        white? black? blue? green? does it come in all sizes? what<br />
                        about petites? [will they let you take your happiness back if<br />
                        it doesn’t] fit [how long does it last?] what are we talking about<br />
                        [days] [months] [years] and what if your happiness lasts longer<br />
                        than four hours [do you need to contact a medical doctor]<br />
                        [what about a warning label?] and what if you become too happy<br />
                        [you could get addicted] then you’ll need a recovery program<br />
                        [“Hi, my name is Al and I’m happy…”] is there a safe treatment<br />
                        for happiness? [how is it communicated] airborne when talking?<br />
                        expelled in bursts of uncontrolled laughter? maybe<br />
                        [in the exchange of bodily fluids] and when you’re happy<br />
                        [do you want others to see your happiness] making you proud<br />
                        [then making you unhappy with the sin of pride]<br />
                        but I’m happy remembering Superman on television standing<br />
                        for [“Truth, Justice and the American Way!”] and that was his way<br />
                        of being happy [and mine?] it was donning my imaginary cape<br />
                        and leaping off the living room sofa [thinking] “this time, I’ll fly!”

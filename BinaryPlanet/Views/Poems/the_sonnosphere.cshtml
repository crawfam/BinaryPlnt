                    1: Galaxies everywhere. Dense and bright as pixels on a blank white screen.<br />
                    2: On Earth it was an ordinary day of baseball, worship and television violence.<br />
                    3: The Maluvians appeared to Rita in a fractal designed as a dream.<br />
                    5: “Your weakness,” spoke Goron, “is the space you allow for silence.”<br />
                    8: The Sonnosphere was an equation, a poem, and a book of the hidden.<br />
                    13: Mindstorms along the borders made the plot impossible to detect.<br />
                    21: Rita saw lines growing on a thin sliver of the electromagnetic spectrum.<br />
                    34: “What? You thought this would be like an episode of your Star Trek?”<br />
                    55: “Earthlings,” cried the one centimeter alien, “your words are inconsequential.”<br />
                    89: The victims were forced to sing forever, having glimpsed the Sonnosphere.<br />
                    144: “They never knew of life,” thought Goron, “not even a little.”<br />
                    233: Rita’s final aria brought even the blind eye Sun to molten yellow tears.<br />
                    377: As a machine planet the Earth found the solace it’d always sought.<br />
                    610: Beyond the solar winds the Maluvians looked back on a small blue dot.

                    it's already [tomorrow] in Shanghai [midnight]<br />
                    in [Palo Alto] and I'm working with Kumar [aka]<br />
                    "Leisure Suit Larry" using [SQL commands]<br />
                    on big iron [Oracle] with [SELECT statements]<br />
                    and [WHERE clauses] searching [container] ships<br />
                    for a [box] gone missing in the South China Sea<br />
                    [an odd lot] of Jimmy Buffet [bobble heads]<br />
                    200 cases of Blue Ray [DVDs] and five dozen<br />
                    cartons of Popeye the Sailor [punching bags]<br />
                    turned out by 14-year-old Kim working<br />
                    the long shift in an [orange smog] Guangdong<br />
                    [sweatshop] filling orders for a dollar store<br />
                    In [Des Moines] as our deft fingers scour<br />
                    the [shipping lanes] querying transactions<br />
                    [sorting] [filtering] broadband waves<br />
                    of [structured] [information] in climate<br />
                    controlled [darkness] and I'm thinking<br />
                    about the [punching bag] children<br />
                    winding up their short sleeved arms<br />
                    to bash their plastic foes [and the planet<br />
                    we're burning] to make such happiness<br />
                    [and how that's all we ever wanted]<br />
                    when out of the din of [spinning discs]<br />
                    Larry says he's found the [box] at the bottom<br />
                    of a million record database [grinning]<br />
                    as he explains that it was just a case<br />
                    of a mistaken [space] between the "Pop"<br />
                    and the "eye" in the word "Popeye" and<br />
                    out in the valley the virtual night breathes<br />
                    deep as the world again makes sense<br />

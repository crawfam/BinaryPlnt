                        The poem that comes to you <br />
                        knows the way. It will stay for a time<br />
                        but not a long time. It needs
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        nothing. The poem is complete. Always<br />
                        at hand. When you want it to leave<br />
                        it comes back.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The poem bites. It stings. Stands<br />
                        before the law. Innocent and guilty.<br />
                        Judge and jury.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It cannot be summoned.<br />
                        It comes without a calling. Rises<br />
                        and shines. Lies without lying.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Floats over prose. It's weightless.<br />
                        The poem keeps moving. The poem in the air<br />
                        breathes.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The poem on the page<br />
                        is the corpse of the poem. The poem<br />
                        is a thing of ideas.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It runs wild. It can't be caught.<br />
                        The poem is sound. Crafty.<br />
                        It covers its tracks.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The poem that comes to you<br />
                        pulls away the shades. Opens for business.<br />
                        Throws you a line.<br />

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It's a beggar dressed up<br />
                        like a sage. It is the last hour<br />
                        of an empty house.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Unrequited, the poem persists.<br />
                        Unloved, the poem loves. Always the fool.<br />
                        It cannot be outwitted.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The poem that comes to you<br />
                        is yours. If you judge, it will be judged.<br />
                        If you write, it will be written.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The poem that comes to you<br />
                        is nameless. Name it<br />
                        and it will bear your name.
